# Quantum Cortex

This is an experimental rewrite of an Android roguelike game I wrote a few years ago called Quantum Cortex. The old version is written in Java and therefore buggy, inconvenient to maintain, and only available on Android.

The purpose of this rewrite is to get the game on the browser and update the graphics and functionality. I originally wanted to write it in Rust and compile to WASM, but that ecosystem is too immature. This version uses TypeScript and the Phaser 3 engine, so will be hopefully something of a minor improvement in code maintainability.

The latest build is playable at [https://saw79.github.io/qc_ts](https://saw79.github.io/qc_ts)

(Note: development is extremely early so don't expect much yet)
