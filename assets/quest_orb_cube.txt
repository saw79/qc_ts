Special Memo
QuarkTech Industries

To: Quantum Computing Team

Thanks again for letting us borrow your 4x4 quantum suspension aparatus, we used it to get what we're calling an "orb cube" working. We'll clean up and get it back to you by the end of the week, but if you need it before then we're doing testing in the special area in the ****.

Instructions on how to get there are with one of the team members on floor $$$$.
