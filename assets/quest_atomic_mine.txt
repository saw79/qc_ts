To: Advanced Explosives Team

Round 2 of the atomic mine testing is completed: blast radius and blast damage requirements have been met.

On floor #### of the **** area, we've set up a locked room for round 3 testing (explosion resistance). VERY DANGEROUS - DO NOT GO IN THERE. James will be setting off the test at 2 PM tomorrow.
